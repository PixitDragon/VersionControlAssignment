What is Version Control and why is it used?
  Version control is used to see different versions of a project. 
  That way, if you have an error in your current version that didn't 
  exist in the past one, you can go back and fix it. Also, if your 
  current save gets corrupted, you can rebuild prom the prior version 
  instead of having to restart the project.
  
What's the difference between Git and GitHub?
  Git is a command-line tool that lets you save your work, GitHub
  is the server that it's backed up to (and a web application you
  can look at it graphically on)
  
Describe what each of the following commands do in your own words:
  Git Clone
    Copies a version of the project from the cloud to your machine
  Git Status
    Displays which files have not been backed up to the cloud
  Git Add
    Prepare/declare which files should be added to the cloud
  Git Commit -m ""
    Decide finally which files to send, and add a message about what 
    you've changed
  Git Push
    Send the files to the cloud
